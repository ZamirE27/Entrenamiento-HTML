        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, this is Zamir Estrada, I'm 23 years old, I am currently working for a US company as a Customer service representanive</p>
        <p>Since I enrolled on this project in RIwi, I've been getting a lot of skills as a developer, I started without knowing nothing about it,<br>neverthless I'm enyoining the process and  the progress I've got </p>
        <p>I made the decision to join in this project becuase I was looking for a complement, as I mentioned, I'm working for a US company<br>which means I am bilingual, so in order to keep growing professionally this was the better option, the one I found interesting and now <br>that I got certain knowledge, I found out a passion for Software development</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Project 1: Calculate the total cost of a purchase in a store </h3>
        <p>This was the first project I've made in python where we calculate the total cost of a purchase in a store,<br>We used simple conditionals and nested conditionals so we could make some validations </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project 2: Grades validation </h3>
        <p>Here we were requested to create a code that would vali multiple notes meeting the requested requirements and features.<br>to achieve this we used loops(For and while) and conditionals </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project 3: Inventories management (CRUD) </h3>
        <p>I developed a Python program that efficiently manages a store's product inventory by applying parameterized functions,<br>lambda functions, and data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project 4: </h3>
        <p>This iis my first project I've made in python where we calculate the total cost of a purchase in a store</p>
